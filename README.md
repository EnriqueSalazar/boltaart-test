This project uses:
- React
- Redux
- React Router Redux
- Bootstrap for layout
- MaterialUI for icons mostly

The data provided was loaded through a Redux action and loaded to the store.

Comments of the main decisions are inside each component.

We used create-react-app to initialize the app to provide standard functionality with the minimum boilerplate.
